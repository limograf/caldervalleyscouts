      <description>About 8th/26th Calder Valley Scouts We meet at Central Methodist Church, Todmorden and have been in existence over 50 years. We accept all Christian denominations and all religions or none. We do not attend regular church parades at Central, but we do support the RBL’s remembrance day and Veteran’s day parades. We also support Todmorden Gang Show, which has been running nearly as long as the Group!
The boys and girls in the Group do loads of activities around Todmorden and further afield.</description>

      <description>We have 2 minibuses which are available for use by other community groups.
Our newer bus is a 2013 Ford Transit 17 seater. This bus has a towbar fitted so can be used with a trailer. As it is over 3.5 tonnes, drivers need category D1 on their licence to drive this bus.
Our second bus is a 2006 LDV Convoy. It is a 17 seater again, but 12 of the seats are removable and it has a wheelchair lift fitted.</description>

Testimonial from Pip, aged 12 Hi, my name is Pip and I have been in the scouting community since Beavers. I joined Scouts in 2018, just before the summer and went on camp. Camp is really fun as it is 8 days long and you sleep in tents every night.</description>

      <description>Volunteering with Scouts Each week, we give over 450,000 young people the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed. We’re talking about teamwork, leadership and resilience – skills that have helped Scouts become everything from teachers and social workers to astronauts and Olympians.
We believe in bringing people together. We celebrate diversity and stand against intolerance, always. We’re part of a worldwide movement, creating stronger communities and inspiring positive futures.</description>
