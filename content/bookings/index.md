We have 2 minibuses which are available for use by other community groups.

Our newer bus is a 2013 Ford Transit 17 seater. This bus has a towbar fitted so can be used with a trailer. As it is over 3.5 tonnes, drivers need category D1 on their licence to drive this bus.

Our second bus is a 2006 LDV Convoy. It is a 17 seater again, but 12 of the seats are removable and it has a wheelchair lift fitted. This means it can be used as a 17 seat bus, or with fewer seats to give more space for bags and equipment. It also means it can be driven on a standard B1 car driving licence.

As both of these minibuses have been bought with some very generous grant funding, we are charging as little as possible for community use.

Rates for both minibuses are **50p per mile including all fuel**, with a minimum charge of **Â£15 per day**. Please pay the day rate to reserve the day.
