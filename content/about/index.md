### About [8th/26th Calder Valley](https://scouts.org.uk/groups/8th26th-calder-valley-scout-group) Scouts

We meet at [Central Methodist Church](https://calderdalemethodists.org.uk/churches/todmorden.php), Todmorden and have been in existence over 50 years. We accept all Christian denominations and all religions or none. We do not attend regular church parades at Central, but we do support the [RBL’s remembrance day](https://www.britishlegion.org.uk/get-involved/remembrance/about-remembrance) and Veteran’s day parades. We also support [Todmorden Gang Show](https://www.todgangshow.org.uk/), which has been running nearly as long as the Group!

The boys and girls in the Group do loads of activities around Todmorden and further afield. We have our own minibuses, which we use for camps and trips, and which are available for use by other community groups.

We welcome and encourage you to join us!
