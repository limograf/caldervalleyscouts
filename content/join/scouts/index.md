## Scouts 11 to 14 years

Scouts are for boys and girls from 11 to 14 years old, and meet from 7.30pm to 9.15pm every Thursday.

### Testimonial from Charlotte

I enjoy coming to scouts as it is a nice way to get outdoors and do fun activities with professionals. It is also a really great atmosphere as everyone is so inclusive and I would 100% recommend coming to make new friends and memories.
