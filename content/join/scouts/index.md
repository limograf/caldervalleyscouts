## Scouts 11 to 14 years

Scouts are for boys and girls from 11 to 14 years old, and meet from 7.30pm to 9.15pm every Thursday. 

### Testimonial from Pip, aged 12

Hi, my name is Pip and I have been in the scouting community since Beavers. I joined Scouts in 2018, just before the summer and went on camp. Camp is really fun as it is 8 days long and you sleep in tents every night. Camp is optional but I recommend going. At the end of each camp the leaders vote on who they think has been the best scout on camp and that person will get a prize. Last camp we started doing best patrol so the best patrol got ‘Best Patrol 2019’ embroided on their neckerchief. 

Scouts is a great thing to join as we do activities during the holidays such as trampolining, swimming and we sometimes go to Mcdonalds or Burger King on the way back!
