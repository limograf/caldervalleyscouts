## Volunteering with Scouts

Each week, nationwide, we give over 450,000 young people (over 100 in Todmorden) the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed. We’re talking about teamwork, leadership and resilience – skills that have helped Scouts become everything from teachers and social workers to astronauts and Olympians.

We believe in bringing people together. We celebrate diversity and stand against intolerance, always. We’re part of a worldwide movement, creating stronger communities and inspiring positive futures.

If you would like to have fun, take part in outdoor (and indoor) adventures, learn new skills and give young people the opportunity of a lifetime – then you may be just the right person to help with the Group.

No specific skills are required and full training and support is given. Some experience of working with children/young people may be useful but is not essential. This is a great opportunity to gain experience of working with young people, in a supported, enjoyable environment.
### Frequently Asked Questions:

#### Q. Do I need to have been a Scout/Cub when I was young?
A. No, what is important is an ability to relate to young people, and an interest in learning new skills

#### Q. Will I have to wear a uniform?
A. We have both uniformed and non-uniformed adult helpers. We would recommend anyone who is potentially interested in helping to take things slowly and see where they think they will best fit in.

#### Q. What about CRB checks?
A. All adult helpers have to undergo a CRB check before they can start to help with your people, this is the law of the land. This involves the completion of a relatively simple questionnaire (which we will help you with). There are no costs involved, and the process takes a few weeks.

#### Q. Does this mean I can’t help if I have a criminal record?
A. This would depend on what the record was for, and how long since the offence. Do not assume the worst, if you have any concerns then we will try and address them.

#### Q. What time would I be expected to commit to?
A. Ideally we would want the helpers to be available for the regular weekly meetings, as far as is possible. There is also a training commitment for all uniformed leaders, but we are talking about a few hours a year. Apart from the above the time that you give will be very much up to you.
