      <description>As Scouts, we believe in preparing young people with skills for life. we encourage our young people to do more, learn more and be more.
Each week, we give over 450,000 young people the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed. We’re talking about teamwork, leadership and resilience – skills that have helped Scouts become everything from teachers and social workers to astronauts and Olympians.</description>
